Since 2015, I have worked with collaborators on developing and analyzing tree-ring chronologies from Guatemala and Honduras. For my undergraduate honors thesis, I generated the first tree-ring chronology for Totonicap&aacute;n, Guatemala. A paper on the full network of chronologies that has been developed over the last 10 years is forthcoming - stay tuned!
