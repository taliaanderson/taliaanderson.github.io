This project was the focus of my dissertation research. I combined multiple information sources to evaluate changes in extreme events and rainfall in Guatemala and explored how climate information is and can be used by farmers to better adapt to climate changes. 
My first chapter uses a sophisticated statistical modeling approach to understand the role of natural climate variability in the 2015-2019 drought in Central America and was published in [Geophysical Research Letters](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL105391).
We found that the 2015-2019 drought was extremely rare, but could occur even without the influences of anthropogenic climate change. Based on future climate projections for the region, droughts as bad or worse than this one are expected. 
My second chapter combined satellite-based climate data and interviews with over 700 smallholder farming households and is published in [Climatic Change](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-025-03978-5). 
The climate data analyses in this paper indicate that trends in rainfall are widely variabile depending on region and time period of interest. Interviews with smallholder farmers also revealed a wide range in perceptions of recent rainfall trends. 
We showed that farmers who perceived recent changes in rainfall were more likely to adapt their agricultural maize practices, but that these changes were mediated by their income sources and dependence on agriculture. 
Ultimately, we found that it is essential to reconcile individual and community perceptions with observed and anticipated changes to ensure appropriate adaptation strategies within the specific agricultural context. 
My third and final chapter was focused on the quality and usability of seasonal climate forecasts and information among smallholder farmers. The manuscript is published in [Weather, Climate, and Society](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/18/1/WCAS-D-25-0001.1.xml).
We found that the technical skill of published forecasts varies regionally, but that many of the model configurations used in the last five years could have provided some useful climate information. 
However, we also showed that very few smallholder farmers know about these forecasts or have access to them. We provided some recommendations for improving future seasonal forecasts in the region in terms of technical quality and societal value.
