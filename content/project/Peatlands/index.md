This research project began as part of a Fulbright Study and Research Fellowship in collaboration with the Instituto de Conservaci&oacute;n, Biodiversidad y Territorio in Valdivia, Chile and the Laboratorio de Geo-Informaci&oacute;n y Percepci&oacute;n Remota in Valpara&iacute;so, Chile. I used satellite imagery to monitor changes in greenness and to assess how climate factors like temperature and precipitation influence the productivity of the peatlands.
