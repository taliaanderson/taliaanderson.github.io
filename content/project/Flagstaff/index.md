This research project began as part of a Fulbright Study and Research Fellowship in collaboration with the Instituto de Conservacion, Biodiversidad y Territorio in Valdivia, Chile and the Laboratorio de Geo-Información y Percepción Remota in Valparaíso, Chile. I used satellite imagery to monitor changes in greenness and to assess how climate factors like temperature and precipitation influence the productivity of the peatlands.
