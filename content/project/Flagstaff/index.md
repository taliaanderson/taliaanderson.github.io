This project is the result of a collaboration between the Climate Assessment for the Southwest ([CLIMAS](https://climas.arizona.edu/)) program at the University of Arizona and Flagstaff Water Services ([FWS](https://www.flagstaff.az.gov/1275/Water-Services)). The overarching question at the heart of this research is: how do Upper Lake Mary (ULM) water levels respond to climatic conditions in the Rio de Flag and Walnut Creek watersheds? We find that cool season (Nov-Mar) precipitation consistently plays the most important role in determining ULM lake levels. This emphasizes the primary influence of combined winter snow accumulation and early spring precipitation on lake levels for the upcoming summer. However, we also suggest that temperatures may be playing an increasingly important role in determining lake levels in more recent years.
